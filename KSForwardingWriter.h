#pragma mark Creating a Writer
- (id)initWithOutputWriter:(id <KSWriter>)stream; // designated initializer
- (id)init; // calls -initWithOutputWriter with nil. Handy for iteration & deriving info, but not a lot else


#pragma mark Primitive

- (void)writeString:(NSString *)string; // calls -writeString: on our string stream. Override to customize raw writing
