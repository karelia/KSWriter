#pragma mark Encoding as Data

// if precompose == YES, then Unicode Normalization Form C is applied to the output. This is handy for distributing to platforms which don't have as good unicode support as Apple's. More details at http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#qa/qa1235/_index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/DTS10001757

#pragma mark Custom Writing

// If the block isn't explicitly encoding data and you've nothing better to choose, go for NSUTF16StringEncoding

// Designated initializer, generally only useful for custom subclasses
// Encoding may be used as a hint for buffering

#pragma mark Properties

#pragma mark Output

// A string comprised of all the non-buffered strings written so far
// nil if the receiver wasn't created using `+stringWriterWithEncoding:`

#pragma mark Buffering

- (void)discardBuffer;  // discards the last buffer

- (void)flushFirstBuffer;   // flushes only the first buffer, leaving any others intact

- (void)writeString:(NSString *)string toBufferAtIndex:(NSUInteger)index;   // 0 bypasses all buffers


#pragma mark Flush-on-write
- (void)flushOnNextWrite;   // calls -flush at next write. Can still use -discardBuffer to effectively cancel this
- (void)cancelFlushOnNextWrite;


#pragma mark Lifecycle
- (void)close;  // clears any buffers and stops writing to output
