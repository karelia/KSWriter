Features
========

KSWriter shamelessly rips off Java's Writer classes. It allows you to build up strings, piping them straight through to destination's such as:

* `NSMutableString`
* `NSMutableData` or an `NSOutputStream`
* A custom block of your design

This is generally more efficient than building up a large `NSMutableString` yourself. When outputting data, KSWriter can perform services like normalizing unicode character sequences for you.

KSWriter also provides buffering facilities for extra control.

Usage
=====

### Vanilla ###

Add `KSWriter.h` and `KSWriter.m` to your project. Ideally, make this repo a submodule, but hey, it's your codebase, do whatever you feel like.

### XML/HTML/CSS ###

[KSHTMLWriter](https://github.com/karelia/KSHTMLWriter) builds on KSWriter to provide classes for generating string formats such as XML and HTML. It directly includes KSWriter as a submodule. It can also be built as a framework for Mac distribution, with the whole of KSWriter included and exposed.

Release Notes
=============

### 2.0

* The codebase has been collapsed down to a single `KSWriter` class
* There is no longer a `KSWriter` protocol, just the class. `NSMutableString` is no longer a valid writer; instead create one using `+writerWithMutableString:encoding:` or `+stringWriterWithEncoding:`
* The primitive writing method is `-writeString:range:` which allows writers to more efficiently extract just the desired range of characters, without the overhead of creating a temporary string. `-writeString:` is still present, of course, as a convenience
* All `KSWriter` instances have a `.stringEncoding` property. Even when not outputting raw data, this may be used to optimise internal buffers. It's particularly handy for classes like `KSXMLWriter` who build on `KSWriter` and need to know the encoding of their final output
* Similarly, all writers now have buffering facilities available to them
* Writing to `NSMutableData` supports precomposing
