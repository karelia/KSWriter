Features
========

KSWriter shamelessly rips off Java to provide a common interface for building up strings.

Questions about the code should be left as issues at https://github.com/karelia/KSWriter or message me on Twitter.

Dependencies

None beyond Foundation. Probably works back to OS X v10.0 if you were so inclined.

Usage
=====

### Vanilla ###

Add `KSWriter.h` and `KSWriter.m` to your project. These files define the common interface `-writeString:` for building up strings, as well as more advanced possibilities. Ideally, make this repo a submodule, but hey, it's your codebase, do whatever you feel like.

You can use `NSMutableString` instances directly, or add other, specialist writers into your project, such as:

* KSStringWriter
* KSBufferedWriter
* KSMutableDataWriter
* KSOutputStreamWriter

`KSForwardingWriter` provides a handy starting point for your own classes that work by piping output through to another `KSWriter`.

### XML/HTML/CSS ###

[KSHTMLWriter](https://github.com/karelia/KSHTMLWriter) builds on KSWriter to provide classes for generating string formats such as XML and HTML. It directly includes KSWriter as a submodule. It can also be built as a framework for Mac distribution, with the whole of KSWriter included and exposed.
